### What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power,database storage,applications, and other IT resources through a cloud service platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

AWS allows to scale-up or down and vice-versa.

Aloows for auto scaling and create rules that reduce the server size based on the traffic


Cloud Characteristics -> Elasticity

Most of the services in the cloud are elastic in nature.

Elasticity and scalability go hand in hand

There are two types of scalability -

- Vertical Scalability(Scale UP)
- Horizantal Scalability(Scaling OUT)
	Use similar server of same configuration instead of one single bigger server and are managed via load balancers.

If CPU > 70% then spin up 3 more services.

On meeting these conditions it scales automatically and thus called auto-scaling

If CPU < 50% then scale out.

### Era of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing made all the resources e.g. Compute,Storage,Networking etc .. as sevices.It converts Capital Expenditure to Operational Expenditure.

These services are,

- Available on-demand
- Pay as you go(Per second,per hour billing or pay only for execution)
- Elastic services
- Managed via internet
- Fast Deployement
- Can be automated
